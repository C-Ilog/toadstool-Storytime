A short man wearing a mushroom cap was eating Bratwurst in a Biergarten.

A strange woman, leash for her Hund in one hand and a Doener in the other, walked up to the man, and said "Hallo, where is the Flughafen?"

The short man points north towards the Hauptstrasse but before he can speak a klimaanlage falls on him.

The people inside the Baeckerei near the Biergarten jumped out of their Lederhose from the sound of the drop and screamed, "Mein Gott!"

The short man fell out of his Porsche exclaiming "Stupid horse I just fell out of the Porsche!"

The woman, feeling sorry for the man's Porsche getting wrecked by the klimaanlage, offered to take him to the Ratskeller and buy him some brot.

While they were at the Ratskeller buying brots, the barkeep wearing a Dirndel and Lederhose at the same time (how strange!) suggested that the couple visit the Baeckerei upstairs to purchase the "Best Gabaeck on this side of the Eltz"

They went to Baeckerei but were met with the Great Queen Mehlase of the Eltz, she turns her head at them and says "Who are you looking at?" before blasting them with her powerful fire breath.

They tried to escape but the disguised henchmen placed a schloss on the doors! How will our heros ever escape? 

Then suddenly, a klimaanlage came flying through the door, breaking it down and letting them escape.
